Gcode Buttons
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I revised Meteyous G-Code Buttons because I really liked the idea but didn't like the uneven illumination.
Also I wanted them to have different colors with different status (e.g. bed temp from blue to red while heating).

Assemble Guide
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Print the base and lock with 4 Perimeters and 100% infill
- Print the shade in a light diffusing filament and glue it with a drop of glue to your button (don't glue your button itself together)
- LED holder is designed to hold the LED on the button but just click it in place (I also glued it together because it fall off several times while assembling the skirt)
- Put everything in place like shown in the explode image
- I soldered all my LEDs in a row and connected one pin of the button to the 5V and the other one to a free pin on a skr

Furthermore:
- I revised the 2.4 skirts (and the ones for the common z-mod) so that the lower hexagon row also can take in buttons
- The hardcore version enlarged the lower outer one also if you want to fit a button in there too, that makes it a bit more challanging to print them
